Abstract = {In recent years, Web applications have grown rapidly because of their abilities to provide online information access to anyone at anytime around the world. As Web applications become complex, there is a growing concern about their quality and reliability. This paper extends traditional data flow testing techniques to Web applications. Several data flow issues about analyzing HyperText Markup Language (HTML) documents in Web applications are discussed. An object-based data flow testing approach is presented. The approach is based on a test model that captures data flow test artifacts of Web applications. In the test model, each entity of a Web application is modeled as an object. The data flow information of the functions within an object or across objects is then captured using various flow graphs. Based on the object-based test model, data flow test cases for a Web application can be systematically and selectively generated in five different levels. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

@article{dlf07,
Abstract = {Software testing is a difficult task and testing Web-based applications may be even more difficult, due to the peculiarities of such applications. In the last years, several problems in the field of Web-based applications testing have been addressed by research work, and several methods and techniques have been defined and used to test Web-based applications effectively. This paper will present the main differences between Web-based applications and traditional ones, how these differences impact the testing of the former ones, and some relevant contributions in the field of Web application testing developed in recent years. The focus is mainly on testing the functionality of a Web-based application, even if some discussion about the testing of non-functional requirements is provided too. Some indications about future trends in Web application testing are also outlined in the paper.},
